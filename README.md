# Prototypes, Inheritance and Classes

This challenge focuses on using the `this` keyword as well as getting comfortable with prototypes and classes by building out a fantasy themed video game and your family tree.

## Set Up The Project With Git

**Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:**

* [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
* [ ] Add your group lead as collaborator on Github.
* [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Gabi's by mistake!).
* [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
* [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
* [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

**Follow these steps for completing your project.**

* [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into main (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
* [ ] Add your group lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
* [ ] Your group lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into main.

## Assignment Set Up

* Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.
* To test your `console.log()` statements, open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.  

## The `this` keyword

Having a solid understanding of how `this` works will give you a huge advantage when you start building with more advanced frameworks. Use the [this.js](this.js) file to traverse through a few `this` problems.

## Prototype

The prototype challenge will focus on building prototypes for a fantasy themed game that includes mages, swordsmen, and archers.  Follow the [prototypes.js](prototypes.js) instructions closely to create the beginnings of what could be an awesome JavaScript game.

## Classes

The classes assignment will test your knowledge of creating blueprint class and extending it to other classes. You will be creating class for each member of your family and using a method to create a profile for them.  Follow the [classes.js](classes.js) instructions closely to create the beginnings of what could be an application in the future.

* Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges. 
* Remember to un-comment the objects and console logs to test your work at the bottom of the page.
